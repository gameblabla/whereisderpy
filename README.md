This version  :  September 16th 2015

Where's Derpy was a Flash game originally made by pepperpunk.
I have re-programmed (unofficially) the game for a lot of platforms.

The goal is to find Derpy and the three muffins in 30 seconds.

INSTALLATION
=================

You need a TI Nspire with Ndless 3.1+ installed.
Once Ndless is installed , all you have to do is to send derpy.tns file to the calc with a software like Ti-nspire computer link or TILP.
Once you transfered it, go to my documents and start derpy.tns.
Have fun !
